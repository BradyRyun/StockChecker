# StockChecker

This is a simple stock checking application that will output to the command line information regarding your Robinhood account.
To get started, you will need python install on your machine.
Run 
```
pip install robin_stocks
pip install numpy
```
Once you've done this, simply run the main.py file.
You'll be prompted to enter your username/password for Robinhood.
I was originally prompted with an SMS message for 2FA. If you experience any issues with logging in, please let me know and I can add 2FA options to the script.
